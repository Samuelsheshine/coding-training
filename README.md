Hi there!I am a beginner in programming and have always been passionate about software development. Recently, I've been focusing on learning the basics of Python, and I'm using this GitHub repository to share my learning journey. In this repository, you'll find some fundamental concepts I've learned, simple code examples, and a few small projects.
